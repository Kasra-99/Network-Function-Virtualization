In this workshop, we will get introduced to Docker and Open vSwitch as the fundamental technologies for creating
virtual network topologies. Sections 2 and 3 provide relevant background and usage respectively of Docker and Open
vSwitch. 

1 Expected outcome
In this workshop, the student would learn about:
1. Using Docker as virtualization tool to create virtual hosts
2. Using Open vSwitch to create a virtual network topology
3. Connect the virtual hosts to virtual switches and test connectivity
This workshop and all subsequent ones need to be implemented on a Linux host. All workshops have been tested
on an Ubuntu 16.04 Virtual Machine on VirtualBox.
